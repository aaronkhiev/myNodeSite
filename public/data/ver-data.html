<h3>Backstory</h3>
<p>
    Once a well respected Lieutenant, Verdan was a noble and charismatic leader. 
    Behind closed doors however, he was a spiteful and ruthless figure. 
    Not a single ounce of mercy was spared to those that opposed him, not to mention his tendency to toy with his opponents before ending them slowly. 
    After the attack on Wave Echo Cave that sent shockwaves through the very fabric of reality, 
    an ancient parasite managed to weave its way into his psyche further distorting his sense of self and driving him to the pinnacle of madness and power.
