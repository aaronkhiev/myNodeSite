<h3>Backstory</h3>
<p>
    The profits that were being raked in allowed Thistle to expand their business and hire some lifelong friends to reap the benefits from the less than legal trade. 
    Unfortunately for Thistle, disaster struck when the once small business attracted the attention of "The Weavers", a much larger syndicate that controlled nearly all incoming flow of products. 
    After a supply run, Thistle returned to their home to find nothing but the ruins of their family business along with effigies of all the employees of The Perennial, 
    bodies nailed into the ground. From the burning ruins, one of the syndicate leaders belonging to "The Needle", emerged from the ashes and rushed towards them brandishing a large rusted rapier like weapon. 
    Thistle quickly took off into the dense brush hiding their appearance leaving behind generations of work. 
    Like the name suggests, "The Perennial", although burned to the ground would forever remain with Thistle. For The Perennial was not simply a business, but a legacy that would return in the coming seasons. 
    Some time after the raid on Thistle's business, they took it upon themselves to take up adventuring and rebuild their business through anonymous transactions with other adventurers.
    "They may have murdered my employees, they will never murder my business" they proclaimed. 
    Fueled by petty spite and the desire to overtake The Weavers, Thistle weaved their business into the very fabric of adventuring. With the added benefit of always being on the move, 
    Thistle would remain an elusive trader, always being able to hide from the prying eyes of The Weavers.
