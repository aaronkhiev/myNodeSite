        <desc>A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. 
            Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 
            The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the area that arenâ€™t being worn or carried.</desc>
