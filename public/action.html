        <h2>Initiative</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Since combat is more of a DM lead segment, we'll only be going over what you the player, should be familiar with. When your Dungeon Master declares a combat
                    encounter, you and all the other players will be prompted to roll something called an initiative roll. The initiative roll determines the order everyone plays in
                    during combat. For instance, if you roll a 5 and your friend rolls a 4, you will go first then your friend goes second. The DM will roll initiative for anyone you
                    are going up against or any non-playable characters. Let's look at an example. Do note that your initiative is affected by ability scores, specifically your Dexterity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>You roll an 8.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Goblin A rolled an 8.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Friend A rolled a 5.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>Goblin B rolled a 2.</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This would mean that you and Goblin A would go first since you both have the highest initiative. But what if you have the same initiative roll? You then look
                    at your Dexterity Ability Score. If you have the higher DEX score you would go first, if not then the Goblin would go first. If you both have the same
                    Dexterity score, you would both roll to see who gets the higher number. Whoever gets the higher number would go first. Now that we've established turn order
                    what do you actually do during combat or how does it work?
                </p>
            </div>
        <h2>Turns & Rounds</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    We've established the order each person goes in, this is called turn order. After each person goes and we circle back to the person at the top of the initiative
                    order (Cycle Back To The First Person), we say that a round has been finished. Each round represents 6 seconds of game time. This entire cycle of turns and rounds
                    is "The Order of Combat". This will end once the fight is over.
                </p>
            </div>
        <h2>Action Economy</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Combat can be boiled down to things called "Actions". Actions determine the types of things you can do on your turn. Below are a list of these actions that you get
                    once per turn.
                </p>
            </div>
        <h2>Action</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    With an action you can do things such as attack, dodge, hide, search, dash, cast a spell, disengage, and more.
                </p>
            </div>
        <h2>Bonus Action</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Despite the name, a bonus action does not mean you get to get an extra action, it simply means you are able to use an ability, spell, or
                    trait from your class or background. It may seem confusing at first, but as you navigate through your campaign, your class and background will
                    enable more types of bonus actions and abilities to use.
                </p>
            </div>
        <h2>Movement</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    When creating your character, you have something called "Walking Speed" which determines how far you move each turn.
                </p>
            </div>
        <h2>Reaction</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Reactions are a special type of action in that they don't occur on your turn. You can use a reaction during an enemy's turn or ally's turn. Reactions
                    are special in that they are usually limited to attacks of opportunity or spells and abilities. Consult your DM for more information on the available
                    actions depending on the sourcebooks you are using for your campaign.
                </p>
            </div>
        <h2>Combat Log</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    Since we can't demo a live session through text, here is a small combat log of what one would look like:
                </p>  
                <p>
                    Player A: Uses their action to hide, bonus action cast the Misty Step Spell to teleport away, uses their 30 feet of movement to run away.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lich: Uses movement of 40 feet to run in the direction the player may be in. Uses their action to search for traces of the hidden player...but!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Player A: Uses their reaction to cast the Silvery Barbs Spell to make the Lich fail their ability check.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is one example of what running away from combat would look like. The player exhausts as many action resources as possible to make distance rather
                    than fight a strong enemy. In a situation where you have to fight, balancing your resources is important.
