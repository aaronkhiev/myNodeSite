        <h2>What is a Table Top game? What is the Fantasy Table Top Compendium?</h2>
        <hr />

        <p>
            <strong>Table Top</strong> games refer to any game that can 
            be played on any flat surface or "table" like the name suggests. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The <strong>Fantasy Table Top Compendium</strong> is a tool that
            focuses specifically on roleplaying table top games such as 
            Dungeons & Dragons 5e to Pathfinder. While these games are incredibly 
            rewarding, they also have an incredibly difficult learning curve and 
            isn't as accessible to those just starting out fresh. The Compendium 
            will help you generate character stats with explanations for ability scores, feats, and 
            general character building assistance. This site also provides resources for 
            Game Masters (Also known as Dungeon Masters) to help support encounters, general 
            worldbuilding, and story writing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since the basic rules of DnD are provided for free, this site will only cover specific portions
            of DnD such as poorly explained game mechanics, to even character roleplay and etiquette which is
            not included in the original rulebook.
        </p>

            The Table Top Compendium was created as a gateway for creatives to get into table top games
            without having to endure the steep learning curve that comes with it. TTRPGs are heavily gatekept
            either through paywalls or a lack of accessible information about getting started. Through the TC Compendium
            we hope to see more people get involved and really express themselves through the art of character roleplay,
            worldbuilding, and more importanly getting to have fun through this unique game experience. Whether 
            you are an experienced player or new to the world of TTRPGs there is something here for you~!
