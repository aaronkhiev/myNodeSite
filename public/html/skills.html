        <h2>Ability Scores</h2>
            <p>
                In the world of Dungeons & Dragons, all of your character's physical, mental, maybe even magical abilities are all measured in ability scores.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are a total of 6 abilities which provide a quick description of every creature's physical and mental characteristics:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <!-- Maybe draw icons for each stat? With explanations on hover -->
                <li><strong>Strength</strong>, measuring physical power.</li>
                <li><strong>Dexterity</strong>, measuring agility.</li>
                <li><strong>Constitution</strong>, measuring endurance.</li>
                <li><strong>Intelligence</strong>, measuring reasoning and memory.</li>
                <li><strong>Wisdom</strong>, measuring perception and insight.</li>
                <li><strong>Charisma</strong>, measuring force of personality.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Strength</strong> is pretty straight forward and refers to your brawns and muscle power.
                Can you deadlift an elephant over your head? Can you control your strength just
                enough to break a window without hurting someone? While this ability indicates physical
                prowess, it also indicates how well you can control that strength.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Dexterity</strong> measures your agility, in other words your reaction time, reflexes, to
                even precision and balance. Low dexterity often means you're generally a bit clumsy
                and may miss a target your throwing something at whereas those with higher dexterity 
                scores may hit a target spot on. This also extends to how well you can dodge out of
                the way and maintain balance. Outside of the more physically weary examples, this ability
                can also indicate some degree of finesse especially in lockpicking, forging documents, committing 
                tax fraud, and more very cheeky crimes.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Constitution</strong> refers to your physical endurance. It determines how well
                you can take a hit and how many hits you can take. Aside from physical attacks, this ability
                score also determines how well you can resist poisons, physical effects such as paralysis, to
                even just maintaining consiousness in moments of physical injury, focusing on a spell, or trying 
                not to pass out from one too many drinks at the local tavern.
            </p>   
            <p>
                <strong>Intelligence</strong> is an interesting ability score that measures your logic, reasoning,
                and memory recall not just smarts. This ability indicates how well you can recall information you've previously
                encountered along with how much information you've gathered. In the event you need to solve a puzzle,
                or dig through and thoroughly search areas, to even recalling an enemies weakness or the physics of
                lobbing a mystical ball of fire at an enemies head, intelligence is key.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Wisdom</strong> is the more misinterpreted ability when beginners first run into it. While it is
                tempting to say that this is how wise your character is, it extends a bit further than that. Through your wisdom
                you can also gauge someone's true intentions, if they're lying or telling the truth. This also determines how perceptive
                you are as well with higher wisdom scores being able to hear or see someone stalking behind you just from a quick glance.
                With wisdom, you pick up on what others may fail to see.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Charisma</strong>, the embodiment of your personality or rather your force of personality and how amicable you are
                in the eyes of others. While it is tempting to simply pass off this score as a matter of mastery of flirting, charisma is much
                more than that. This score can determine how good of a leader you are in inspiring others, to even having a silver tongue or lying
                out of what could be a dangerous scenario.
            </p>

        <h2>Dice Rolls</h2>
            <p>
                All of these abilities and scores are great and all but how do we put them into
                practice? As you navigate through your campaign, you will use dice to roll which
                determines how well you perform a task or action. You can test out rolling different
                dice yourself in this section and allocating those numbers to abilities for a blank character!
            </p>

                There are six different types of dice. This includes a d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20.
                The number after the "d" indicates the number of sides the dice has. They all serve
                different purposes from rolling how well you perform a task, to dealing damage. Most
                of your campaign will be spend rolling d20s!
            </p>

        <h2>Modifers</h2>
            <p>
                You now have your rolled scores from above but what does it mean? Depending on what your DM asks you
                to roll, your ability scores can either give you an increase or decrease in the final number. For instance,
                if you were asked to roll an attack roll using your bow, you would use your <strong>Dexterity</strong> score. For
                this scenario let's pretend I have an ability score of 16. I would then roll a twenty-sided dice since attack rolls use a D20
                and ended up getting a 14 on the dice. Since my <strong>Dexterity</strong> score is 16 I would add 3 to that roll for a total
                of 17 as my final number.
            </p>  
            <p>
                As you can see, ability scores have a huge impact at increasing your chances of success. The higher your ability score, the
                higher your modifier!
            </p>
        <hr />

        <h2>Skills</h2>
            <p>
                Once you have established your ability scores, depending on how high or low those scores are can determine how well versed you are
                with a number of skills. There are a number of skills ranging from <strong>Stealth</strong> which is how good you are at sneaking around
                and hiding, to <strong>Deception</strong> which indicates your ability to lie and do it well.
            </p>

        <h2>Ability Checks</h2>
            <p>
                During your campaign, your dungeon master may prompt you to perform a roll of some sort. These are called "Checks" or skill checks and
                can vary based on the type of action you are trying to achieve. For instance:
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>
                    "You look around you to see nothing but the rotting corpses of the city guards roaming towards you searching for their next victim to feast
                    upon. What would you like to do?"
                    <br>- The Dungeon Master
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    "Could I try to hide away and wait for the hoard to pass?"
                    <br>- The Player
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    "Roll a stealth check."
                    <br>- The Dungeon Master
                </em>
            </p>
            <p>    
                During these checks, you will be asked to roll a dice depending on what the Dungeon Master specifies. In nearly
                all cases, you will be rolling a D20, also knows as a twenty sided dice. After rolling your dice, you will add 
                a proficiency modifier/modifier to that roll which comes from how high you ability scores. A good rule of thumb
                is the higher your ability score, the higher your modifer for certain skills. 
            </p>
        <hr />
        <h2>Attack Rolls</h2>
            <p>
                When you want to attack something or someone you make an attack roll against. Depending on your weapon, class, or
                character background you can get penalties or bonuses to this roll. We'll get more into it through the action economy
                and combat. To succeed on an attack roll you must beat the target's armor class. 
            </p>
        
        <hr />
        <h2>Saving Throws</h2>
            <p>
                Saving throws occur when an undesired effect were to affect you. This can include being poisoned, dodging a fireball,
                shaking off the effects of mind control, avoiding spell effects, and much much more. Saving throws are usually announced
                by either the Dungeon Master or the Player when they cast a spell or initiate an effect. You can find some examples in
                the spellcasting section and the action economy.
