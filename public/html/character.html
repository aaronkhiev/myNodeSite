        <h2>Running A Campaign</h2>
            <p>
                 You have your character but now what? Well you now need to establish a group to play with!
                 This can range from just 3 people to even 6 or more! Each group needs a Dungeon Master also known as a DM.
                 This person will be in charge of running and narrating the majority of the story. Do note that it is still a collaborative
                 effort on both ends. Players need to put in their two cents for a functioning and long running campaign.

        <h2>What's the difference</h2>
            <p>
                After looking through the characters and NPCs (Non-Playable Characters), you may ask what the difference is. Well for one Characters are controlled by
                the players whereas the Dungeon Master controls the NPCs. This explains why you get so little information about them when you
                first meet them. All of the juicy backstory and dangerous secrets are all tucked away with the DM and drip fed to the players 
                depending on what you do. The players also do not know the ability scores of NPCs. This knowledge regarding Non-Playable characters
                makes a nice surprise when you least expect it. Imagine trying to rob a store only to realize the clerk/NPC standing on the other side
                of the counter is a retired Gladiator.
